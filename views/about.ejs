            <!-- Added Breakdown of Values and Explanation of Data -->
            <h2>Breakdown of Value:</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Interest Level:</strong> The value represents the relative interest in a search term (query) at that specific point in time. It doesn't give absolute search volume, but rather how the term compares to others over time. Google Trends normalizes the values to reflect the interest relative to the highest point within the chosen timeframe.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Scale of Values:</strong> The values usually range from <strong>0 to 100</strong> (or sometimes slightly below 0 if there's no interest) where <strong>100</strong> is the peak popularity of the search term for that given timeframe, and <strong>0</strong> represents very low or no interest. A higher value means the search term has a higher relative interest compared to the others.
            </p>

            <h2>Analyze Results:</h2>
            <p>
                Trend Analysis shows the results for each query as interest scores over time. These scores are represented as a value between 0 and 100, where the highest value indicates peak popularity for the selected timeframe. The breakdown helps you understand the relative search volume for each query.
            </p>
